Project Overview
This project demonstrates the development of a basic conversational chatbot capable of handling user queries while maintaining conversation context. The chatbot utilizes a language model to generate context-aware responses and stores conversation history for a more natural and continuous dialogue flow.

The main goal of this project is to bridge theoretical knowledge of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Language Models (LLMs) into a practical, working solution.

Features
Language Model Integration: Utilizes pre-trained transformer models for generating responses.

Session History Management: Maintains chat history across multiple turns to preserve context.

Prompt Handling: Separates system prompts and user inputs for structured conversations.

Simple and Extendable Structure: Code designed to be easily extended with new functionalities.

Technologies Used
Python 3.x

Hugging Face Transformers

LangChain

Jupyter Notebook

Installation and Setup
Clone or download the repository.

Install the required Python libraries:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install transformers langchain
Open the Q&A conversation.ipynb notebook using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

Run the cells sequentially to start interacting with the chatbot.

Project Structure
Importing and Initializing Models: Loading pre-trained language models from Hugging Face.

Session State Management: Setting up structures to store past messages.

Prompt and Chat Handling: Separating initial prompts and user interactions.

User Interaction: Capturing user input, processing it through the model, and generating a response.

Future Improvements
Integrate a graphical user interface (GUI) using frameworks like Streamlit or Gradio.

Enable voice input and text-to-speech output for a more natural interaction.

Extend the chatbotâ€™s capabilities by connecting it with external knowledge bases or APIs.

Add functionality for task execution, such as file management or system commands.
